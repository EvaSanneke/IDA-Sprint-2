Documentation of Spint2

The main Code is found in the "Extension(boilerplateCSS)" Folders. I added some other "scrap Codes" to this repository. 
My Process was mainly on the "technical" side. My Codes didn't work for quiet a while, and I wasted a lot of time (and nerves) trying to fix this in the manifest.json file. 
However, the issue was with the sketch.js â€“ I needed to create an instance mode in my code and also use a container, to fix the sketch-canvas ontop of all other page elements.
Once I understood this, the code worked well.
